To include the timestamp adjusted by 5 hours and 30 minutes, you can modify the script as follows:

bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash

# Get current timestamp adjusted by 5 hours and 30 minutes
timestamp=$(date -d "+5 hours +30 minutes" +"%Y%m%d%H%M%S")

# MySQL credentials
db_user="root"
db_password="yourpassword"
db_name="sainu"
table_name="tblEmployee1"

# Backup file path
backup_file="/tmp/dump_${timestamp}.sql"

# Execute the MySQL backup command
mysqldump -u "$db_user" --password="$db_password" "$db_name" "$table_name" > "$backup_file"
